pulse - high or low
each module sends the same pulse to each in its list of destination modules

types of modules:

flip-flop (prefix %) - can be on and off, off by default
    if high - ignore
    if low - toggle state
        on to off - send low
        off to on - send high

conjunction (prefix &) - remember the type of the most recent pulse received from each of their connected input modules
    they initially default to remembering a low pulse for each input.
    update memory then
    if high for all - send low
    else send high

single broadcast (broadcaster)
    outputs = input

aplty - a single button, when pressed send low to broadcaster

- can push the button only after all signals are processed
- order is important
